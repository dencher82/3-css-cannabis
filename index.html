        <b>Medical cannabis</b>, or medical marijuana (MMJ), is cannabis and cannabinoids that are prescribed by
        physicians
        for
        their patients.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_cannabis#cite_note-1"

            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_cannabis#cite_note-2" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup> The use
        of cannabis as medicine has not been rigorously tested due to production and
        governmental restrictions, resulting in limited clinical research to define the safety and efficacy of using
        cannabis to treat diseases.<sup><a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_cannabis#cite_note-3" target="_blank">[3]</a></sup>
        Preliminary evidence suggests that cannabis can reduce nausea and
        vomiting
        during
        chemotherapy, improve appetite in people with HIV/AIDS, reduces chronic pain and muscle
        spasms<sup><a

<div class="classification">
    <h2>Classification</h2>
    <p>
        The National Institute on Drug Abuse defines medical cannabis as "using the whole, unprocessed marijuana
        plant or its basic extracts to treat symptoms of illness and other conditions". A Cannabis plant includes
        more than 400 different chemicals, of which about 70 are cannabinoids. In
        comparison, typical government-approved medications contain only one or two chemicals. The number of
        active chemicals in cannabis is one reason why treatment with cannabis is difficult to classify and
        study. A 2014 review stated that the variations in ratio of CBD-to-THC in botanical and pharmaceutical
        preparations
        determines the therapeutic vs psychoactive effects (CBD attenuates THC's psychoactive effects) of
        cannabis products.

    <h2>Medical uses</h2>
    <p>
        Overall research into the health effects of medical cannabis has been of low quality and it is not clear whether
        it is a useful treatment for any condition, or whether harms outweight any benefit. There is no consistent
        evidence that it helps with chronic pain and muscle spasms. Low quality evidence suggests its use for
        reducing nausea during chemotherapy, improving appetite in HIV/AIDS, improving sleep, and improving tics in
        Tourette syndrome. When usual treatments are ineffective, cannabinoids have also been recommended for
        anorexia, arthritis, glaucoma, and migraine.[19] It is unclear whether American states might be able to
        mitigate the adverse effects of the opioid epidemic by prescribing medical cannabis as an alternative pain
        management drug. It is recommended that cannabis use be stopped in pregnancy.

    <div class="nausea_and_vomiting">
        <h3>Nausea and vomiting</h3>
        <p>
            Medical cannabis is somewhat effective in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) and may be
            a reasonable option in those who do not improve following preferential treatment. Comparative studies
            have found cannabinoids to be more effective than some conventional antiemetics such as prochlorperazine,
            promethazine, and metoclopramide in controlling CINV, but these are used less frequently because of side
            effects including dizziness, dysphoria, and hallucinations. Long-term cannabis use may cause nausea
            and vomiting, a condition known as cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS). A 2016 Cochrane review said that
            cannabinoids were "probably effective" in treating chemotherapy-induced
            nausea in children, but with a high side-effect profile (mainly drowsiness, dizziness, altered moods, and
            increased appetite). Less common side effects were "ocular problems, orthostatic hypotension, muscle
            twitching, pruritus, vagueness, hallucinations, lightheadedness and dry mouth".

    <div class="hiv_aids">
        <h3>HIV/AIDS</h3>
        <p>
            Evidence is lacking for both efficacy and safety of cannabis and cannabinoids in treating patients with
            HIV/AIDS or for anorexia associated with AIDS. As of 2013, current studies suffer from the effects of bias,
            small sample size, and lack of long-term data.

    <div class="pain">
        <h3>Pain</h3>
        <p>
            Research into the use of cannabis for treating chronic pain has yielded inconsistent results for neuropathic
            pain, spasms associated with multiple sclerosis and pain from rheumatic disorders. Cannabis is not effective
            at treating chronic cancer pain. When cannabis is inhaled to relieve pain, blood levels of cannabinoids rise
            faster than when oral products are used, peaking within three minutes and attaining an analgesic effect in
            seven minutes. A 2011 review
            considered cannabis to be generally safe,[30] and it appears safer than opioids in palliative
            care.

    <div class="neurological_conditions">
        <h3>Neurological conditions</h3>
        <p>
            Cannabis' efficacy is not clear in treating neurological problems, including multiple sclerosis (MS) and
            movement problems.[16] Evidence also suggests that oral cannabis extract is effective for reducing
            patient-centered measures of spasticity. A trial of cannabis is deemed to be a reasonable option if
            other treatments have not been effective. Its use for MS is approved in ten
            countries. A 2012 review found no problems with tolerance, abuse, or
            addiction. In the United States, cannabidiol, one of the cannabinoids found in the marijuana plant, has
            been approved for treating two severe forms of epilepsy, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome.

    <div class="posttraumatic_stress_disorder">
        <h3>Posttraumatic stress disorder</h3>
        <p>
            There is no good evidence that medical cannabis is effective for treating posttraumatic stress disorder, and
            its use for this purpose is not recommended.
